This repo contains documentation, mostly in Latex. A workshop paper, a reserach proposal, and more to come.    
  
### Chisel Community Conference 2021   
A presentation on ChiselVerify was given at the Chisel Community Conference 2021. The slides used for said presentation as well as a transcript can be found [here](https://github.com/chiselverify/documentation/tree/master/presentations/CCC2021).  
  
### ChiselVerify Technical report
A technical report, covering the work done on ChiselVerify, up until Jan 2021, can be found [here](https://github.com/chiselverify/documentation/blob/master/chisel-verify/chisel-verify-techrep.tex).   
  
### ChiselVerify NorCaS 2021 paper
A conference paper for the [IEEE Nordic Circuits and Systems Conference](https://events.tuni.fi/norcas2021/), which presents the framework as a whole and discusses the work done leading up to it, can be found [here](https://github.com/chiselverify/documentation/blob/master/chisel-verify/chisel-verify-paper.tex).

### Exploratory Functional Coverage driven fuzzing WOSET 2021 paper  
A short conference paper for the [4th Workshop on Open-Source EDA Technology (WOSET)](https://woset-workshop.github.io/), which presents the begining of a project exploring the impact of using Functional Coverage as a fine-grained metric to drive fuzzing of Chisel designs on the fuzzing performance. Slides used in the workshop presentation, as well as a transcript of the talk, can be found [here](https://github.com/chiselverify/documentation/tree/master/presentations/WOSET2021_Fuzzing).
  
### Coverage in Chisel Conference paper

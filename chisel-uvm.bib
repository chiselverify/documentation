This has created a demand for improving the overall efficiency of the hardware design and verification cycles. The design efficiency was improved with the introduction of Chisel. However, verification efficiency has yet to be tackled. One method that can increase verification efficiency is the use of various types of coverage measures. In this paper, we present our open-source, coverage-related verification tools targeting digital designs described in Chisel. Specifically, we have created a new method allowing for statement coverage at an intermediate representation of Chisel, and several methods for gathering functional coverage directly on a Chisel description.},

abstract = {Rocket Chip is an open-source Sysem-on-Chip design generator that emits synthesizable RTL. It leverages the Chisel hardware construction language to compose a library of sophisticated generators for cores, caches, and interconnects into an integrated SoC. Rocket Chip generates general-purpose processor cores that use the open RISC-V ISA, and provides both an in-order core generator (Rocket) and an out-of-order core generator (BOOM). For SoC designers interested in utilizing heterogeneous specialization for added efficiency gains, Rocket Chip supports the integration of custom accelerators in the form of instruction set extensions, coprocessors, or fully independent novel cores. Rocket Chip has been taped out (manufactured) eleven times, and yielded functional silicon prototypes capable of booting Linux.},

@article{Dax2010:temporal-logics,
	abstract = {The IEEE standardized Property Specification Language, PSL for short, extends the well-known linear-time temporal logic LTL with so-called semi-extended regular expressions. PSL and the closely related SystemVerilog Assertions, SVA for short, are increasingly used in many phases of the hardware design cycle, from specification to verification. In this article, we extend the common core of these specification languages with past operators. We name this extension PPSL. Although all ω-regular properties are expressible in PSL, SVA, and PPSL, past operators often allow one to specify properties more naturally and concisely. In fact, we show that PPSL is exponentially more succinct than the cores of PSL and SVA. On the star-free properties, PPSL is double exponentially more succinct than LTL. Furthermore, we present a translation of PPSL into language-equivalent nondeterministic B{\"u}chi automata, which is based on novel constructions for 2-way alternating automata. The upper bound on the size of the resulting nondeterministic B{\"u}chi automata obtained by our translation is almost the same as the upper bound for the nondeterministic B{\"u}chi automata obtained from existing translations for PSL and SVA. Consequently, the satisfiability problem and the model-checking problem for PPSL fall into the same complexity classes as the corresponding problems for PSL and SVA.},

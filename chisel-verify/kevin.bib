% early 2000s papers on Coverage-Directed Test Generation (or biasing)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% one of the most cited (213 citations) papers on automatic stimil generation
% seems to be cited because of the term "Coverage-Directed Test Generation (CDG)", but the proposed solution isn't that great
% also, there is an earlier paper (Cost Evaluation of Coverage Directed Test Generation) that uses
% the CDG term in 2001

%\subsection{Popular Abstract}
%
%Digital systems are a central part of our current and future digital enhanced live. Denmark has a considerable industry in the design and development of digital systems. However, designing and verifying such digital systems becomes an ever-growing challenge. The main issue is the usage of old tools compared to tools for programming those devices. This project aims to apply tools and methods from software development to hardware development to increase productivity. Danish firms will benefit from the results of this project.



\section{Introduction and Objectives}
\label{sec:objectives}

We can no longer depend on Moore's Law to increase computing performance~\cite{dark-silicon:2011}.
Performance increase with general-purpose processors has come to a halt.
The only way to achieve higher performance or lower energy consumption
is by building domain-specific hardware accelerators~\cite{domain-hw-acc:2020}.
These accelerators can be built in chips or in FPGAs in the cloud.
The production of a chip is costly. Therefore, it is essential to get
the design right at the first tape-out. Thorough testing and verification of the design is mandatory.

To efficiently develop and verify those accelerators, we can learn from software development trends such as agile software development~\cite{agile:manifesto}.
We believe that {\bf we need to adapt to agile hardware development}~\cite{henn-patt:turing:2019}.
%
As accelerators become part of the cloud service, i.e., FPGAs in the cloud,
software developers will increasingly need to adapt critical algorithms to FPGAs to enhance performance.
Hence, it is imperative to make accelerator design accessible for software developers.
By adapting hardware accelerator design to the methods and tools of contemporary software design,
it is possible to bridge both domains catering for a more uniform hardware/software development process.

Until a few years, the two main design languages Verilog and VHDL dominated the
design and testing of digital circuits.
%However, both languages are decades behind
%modern languages for software development.
However, compared to software development and testing, digital design and testing methods
and tools lack several decades of development. Within this project, we plan to
{\bf leverage software development and testing methods for digital design.}
This project explores the hardware construction language Chisel~\cite{chisel:dac2012} with Scala
and the Universal Verification Method (UVM) with SystemVerilog~\cite{SystemVerilog} for
the design and test of digital systems.

This project aims to develop a method and concrete tools for agile hardware development.
We will use tools, languages, development, and testing methods from the last decades in
software development and apply them to hardware design.
We aim to {\bf raise the tooling level for a digital design to increase productivity}.
Time for verifying (testing) of digital systems is about double the time of developing
them in the first place.
Therefore, this project's central focus is on {\bf applying software
testing methods for hardware testing}.

%We will build a combination of open-source tools for verifying
%circuits described in mixed languages (VHDL, SystemVerilog, and Chisel).
%It builds on top of the Chisel hardware construction language and uses Scala to drive the verification. 

\paragraph{Hypothesis} Our hypothesis is that using tools, methods, and languages from the
software domain to describe and verify digital circuits will {\bf considerably increase the productivity}
of digital design and verification engineers.


%We will explore the testing strategy used in UVM in the context of verifying hardware described in Chisel.

%This project proposes a research project that aims at building a testing framework
%in Scala that takes the best methods from UVM and from decades of experience
%in software testing.
%The developed framework shall support mixed languages (VHDL, SystemVerilog, and Chisel)
%to be able to integrate legacy code.
%Furthermore, our aim is to build on open-source projects. Therefore, our
%work will be in open-source as well.

\paragraph{Digital Design.}
VHDL and Verilog are the classic hardware description languages, first appeared in the 1980s.
SystemVerilog~\cite{SystemVerilog}, as an extension to Verilog, adds features from VHDL
for the hardware description and object-oriented features for verification.
Recent advances with SystemVerilog and Chisel \cite{chisel:dac2012, chisel:book} have
brought object-oriented programming into the digital design and verification process.

Chisel is a ``Hardware Construction Language'' embedded in Scala, to describe digital circuits~\cite{chisel:dac2012}.
Scala/Chisel brings object-oriented and functional programming into the world of digital design.
For hardware generation and testing, the full Scala language and Scala and Java libraries are available.
As Scala and Java's full power is available to the verification engineer,
the verification process is also made more efficient.


%Chisel is a hardware construction language embedded in Scala.
%Chisel allows the user to write hardware generators in Scala, an object-oriented and functional language.
%For example, we read in the string based schedules for a network-on-chip
%%\footnote{available at: \url{https://github.com/t-crest/s4noc/tree/master/noc/vhdl/generated}}
%and convert them with a few lines of Scala code into a hardware table to
%drive the multiplexer of the router and the network interface.
%
%Chisel is solely a hardware \emph{construction} language, and thus all valid Chisel code
%maps to synthesizable hardware.
%By separating the hardware construction and hardware verification languages,
%it becomes impossible to write non-synthesizable hardware and in turn, speeds up the design process.



%On open source collection of SystemVerilog classes build the Universal Verification Method,
%which is becoming popular in industry.

\todo{Following is a copy from a paper. Cut down.}
SystemVerilog has become a complex language with more than 250 keywords, and it is unclear
which tools support which language constructs for hardware description.
In contrast with Chisel, when the program compiles, it is synthesizable hardware.
Chisel is a small language, where the cheat sheet fits on two pages.
The power of Chisel comes from the embedding in Scala.
Furthermore, as classic hardware description languages are niche products, not
many tools or libraries are available. 
With Chisel on Scala we have the choice of different integrated development environments (IDE),
testing infrastructure (e.g., ScalaTest), and many free libraries.


%Chisel and Scala are executing on the Java virtual machine and therefore have a very good
%interoperability with Java. Therefore, we can leverage a large pool of Java libraries for
%hardware design and  verification.
%Furthermore, the name space of packets in Scala/Java simplifies integration of
%external components.
%Open source hardware components in Chisel can be organized like software
%libraries at Maven servers.






%%%ZF
\paragraph{Testing Methods.}
Testing is crucial for making software and hardware reliable. The higher
expectation of software quality and shrinking development cycle have
driven programming language researchers and software engineers to
develop a spectrum of \emph{automated testing} techniques.
For example, continuous integration~\cite{duvall2007continuous} 
implements an agile method that automatically runs manually written
%State-of-the-art research in software engineering
%and programming languages address the following two challenges to
%achieve full test automation.

SystemVerilog adds object-oriented concepts for the non-synthesizable verification code.
The SystemVerilog direct programming interface~\cite{Doulos:SV:dpi} allows the programmer to call
C functions inside a SystemVerilog (UVM) testbench.
This enables co-simulation with a ``golden model'' written in C, and the
testbench verifying the device under test (DUT).
With ChiselTest we can co-simulate with Java and Scala models and use the Java Native Interface
to co-simulate with models in C.
%
%The Java JNI (Java Native Interface) allows for a similar functionality in Java programs,
%allowing them to call C functions and use their functionality.
%By using Scala, which is built on Java, it is our hope to use the JNI together with Scala's test frameworks.
%The aim is to develop a framework for co-simulation with Scala/Chisel testers and a
%C-based golden model. This should allow companies to keep their existing C models,
%but move their simulation workflow into Scala/Chisel testers.

The digital design described in Chisel can be tested and verified with
ChiselTest~\cite{chisel:tester2}, a non-synthesizable testing framework for Chisel.
ChiselTest emphasizes usability and simplicity while providing ways to scale up complexity.
Fundamentally, ChiselTest is a Scala library that provides access into the simulator through
operations like poke (write value into circuit), peek (read value from circuit, into the test framework), and step (advance time).
As such, tests written in ChiselTest are just Scala programs, imperative code that runs one line after the next.
This structure uses the latest programming language developments that have been implemented into Scala
and provides a clean and concise interface, unlike approaches that attempt to reinvent the wheel like UVM.

Furthermore, ChiselTest tries to enable testing best practices from software engineering.
Its lightweight syntax encourages writing targeted unit tests by making small tests easy.
A clear and clean test code also enables the test-as-documentation pattern,
demonstrating a module's behavior from a temporal perspective.

The Universal Verification Methodology (UVM) is a methodology for testing and verifying of digital circuits.
UVM is implemented as a SystemVerilog library and utilizes the fact that SystemVerilog uses object-oriented programming when designing test-benches.
Using object-oriented patterns such as inheritance and polymorphism, the verification engineer can design generic components that can be extended and modified to provide application-specific functionality.
As of 2017, UVM has been standardized as IEEE 1800.2~\cite{IEEE:18002}.
UVM is a first step towards truly standardized test-benches.

At the time of writing, little published work was done in the realm of fuzzing for digital circuits.
One project, named RFuzz~\cite{rfuzz2018} and lead by researchers at UC Berkeley, focuses on ``coverage-guided fuzz mutational testing''. This method relies on FPGA-accelerated simulation and new solutions allowing for quick and deterministic memory resetting, to efficiently use fuzzing on digital circuits. The coverage metrics used in this solution are automated and based on branch coverage. RFuzz is currently no longer in development (last commit is from July 2020). RFuzz differs from what we present in this paper in two ways. First, RFuzz uses a simple coverage metric that is independent of the device under test (DUT), while we guide our fuzzing using functional coverage, which inherently contains information about the DUT. Functional coverage is obtained using tools from ChiselVerify~\cite{verify:chisel:2020, dobis2021opensource}.
Another difference is in the randomized program generation, while RFuzz only generates random bit streams, our goal is to focus as well on the generation of coherent random generated programs to test a processor.

\martin{Is this the same as below, or are there more than one Google fuzing projects.}
American fuzzy loop (AFL)~\cite{afl:repo} is a mutation-based fuzzer for software developed by researchers at Google. 
AFL uses a form of branch coverage, known as edge coverage, as a driving metric.
RFuzz, as well as our own solution, is based on AFL. 
The key difference is that AFL is a fuzzer for software, while the two other fuzzers are for digital circuits.
This impacts the way a test is defined, interpreted and mutated~\cite{rfuzz2018}.
Trippel et al. use AFL to apply software fuzzing to hardware~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2102-02308}.
As hardware contains state, test input has to be applied for several clock cycles to activate state transitions.
They transform the one-dimensional test input, generated by AFL, to a sequence of inputs applied
on sequential clock cycles.

As for random program generation, the open-source RISC-V DV framework \cite{riscvdv}, built using python and SystemVerilog, is a notable existing solution. 
However, an implementation in Scala will have the advantage of keeping all internal communications in the same language. 
Our implementation will also not limit itself to one ISA but will provide a general infrastructure for RISC architectures and ISA definitions will be kept as libraries.


{\color{blue}%
\paragraph{Automatic test generation for software.}
Randomised test generation has emerged as one of the most successful approaches
for assessing the correctness of software components. Two key techniques are \emph{fuzzing} and \emph{property-based testing}.

\emph{Fuzzing} is based on the random generation of random test inputs,
and on the observation of program behavior (successful termination or crash) and code coverage
to generate further random inputs \cite{takanen2018fuzzing,DBLP:journals/tse/BohmePR19,DBLP:conf/pldi/FuS17}.
Google's OSS-Fuzz project, for example, has filed over 20 000 bugs in 300 open source
projects (as of June 2020)~\cite{web:oss-fuzz}.

\emph{Property-based testing} generates random tests based on the specification of a component under observation.
Many implementation are based on the seminal paper \cite{DBLP:conf/icfp/ClaessenH00} --- including, e.g., ScalaCheck.
For example, suppose we implement a new operator \texttt{+++} for concatenating two strings:
to check its correctness, we may want to ensure that for any two strings \texttt{a} and \texttt{b},
the result of \texttt{a\,+++\,b} is a string whose length is the sum of \texttt{a}'s and \texttt{b}'s lengths.
Using ScalaCheck, we may call this property \texttt{"concatLength"} and write it as:
%
\noindent%
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Scala,numbers=none]
  property("concatLength") = forAll { (a: String, b: String) =>
    (a +++ b).length == (a.length + b.length)
  }
\end{lstlisting}
%
\noindent%
ScalaCheck will produce sets of random strings \texttt{a} and \texttt{b}, and report an error if it finds a pair that does not satisfy \texttt{"concatLength"}. On the one hand, this technique is more refined than fuzzing, because it has an explicit notion of correctness (expressed by properties); on the other hand, it treats the software under test (like operator \texttt{+++} in the example above) as a black box, hence the random test sample may not achieve adequate coverage of the implementation.

\martin{I don't think this fits into State-of-the-art.}
\paragraph{Vision and challenges.}
Fuzzing and property-based testing techniques may inspire new, more efficient methods for validating hardware designs.
Unfortunately, their adaptation from the software realm to the hardware realm is far from trivial. 
Software fuzzing is based on the actual execution of the program under test; such a program can run at (near-)full speed, and can be easily distributed over thousands of testing nodes via cloud-based fuzzing tools like Google's ClusterFuzz \cite{web:clusterfuzz}.  Instead, hardware designs would be tested while running on a simulator, with decreased performance; moreover, the state space of the design can be extremely large (beyond the reach of any cloud-based systems), and naive random test may not achieve adequate coverage. Property-based testing can (in principle) mitigate the issue: the properties of interest could be used to restrict the testing space; however, there are two open problems: how to express the properties of interest for hardware designs, and how to generate test sets with adequate coverage.

}% end \color{blue}

%% \paragraph{Determining Specification.}
%% The first challenge is how to determine the expected code outcome, or
%% called \emph{specification}.  Software developers often document
%% specifications within the software itself.  \emph{Property-based testing}
%% provides a convenient way of formulating specification as constraints
%% expressed in a domain-specific
%% language~\cite{DBLP:conf/icfp/ClaessenH00}.  For example, developers
%% in the Scala language can specify ``$n^2>0$ for all integer $n$'' in the
%% property-based testing library ScalaCheck~\cite{nilsson2014scalacheck}
%% as follows:
%% \begin{lstlisting}[numbers=none]
%% val propSquare = forAll {(n: Int) => n * n > 0}
%% \end{lstlisting}
%% An efficient approach to obtaining such specifications is to learn from
%% historical bug patterns. Such patterns are gathered in pattern-based
%% software analysis tools, e.g., in
%% FindBug~\cite{DBLP:conf/paste/AyewahPMPZ07} or
%% Scalafix~\cite{web:scalafix}.  Recently, a specification for robotic
%% software is obtained by studying bugs fixed on the Robot
%% Operating System~\cite{nielsenFSW2020dependencybugs}.





%% ZF. This is commeented out because we have decided to not write on
%% the WP related to sanitizers.

%% Another way to generate specification is to use \emph{sanitizers}
%% in compilers. Sanitizers are a common compiler feature that
%% automatically injects run-time checks to capture certain failure
%% conditions~\cite{DBLP:conf/usenix/SerebryanyBPV12}. For example,
%% Google's undefined behavior sanitizer UBSAN checks whether a
%% floating-point variable equals 0 before a division by it; Google's
%% address sanitizer ASAN targets illegal memory access. While
%% sanitizers do not deal with functional correctness as unit tests
%% do, they check low-level, sometimes security-related properties,
%% such as use-after-free, array-index-out-of-bound, or race
%% conditions.

%% \paragraph{Generating Test Inputs.}
%% The second challenge is how to generate interesting test inputs.  The
%% state-of-the-practice uses \emph{fuzzing}, which has emerged as one of
%% the most effective testing techniques for discovering reliability
%% issues in software~\cite{takanen2018fuzzing}.  Google's OSS-Fuzz
%% project, for example, has filed over 20 000 bugs in 300 open-source
%% projects (as of June 2020)~\cite{web:oss-fuzz}.  Fuzzing techniques
%% generate random inputs and improve them based on observed code status,
%% e.g., crashes or code
%% coverage~\cite{DBLP:journals/tse/BohmePR19,DBLP:conf/pldi/FuS17}.
%% Property-based testing~\cite{DBLP:conf/icfp/ClaessenH00}, which is
%% initially designed for testing functional programming languages, uses
%% random data generation, a form of plain fuzzing. For example, by
%% invoking {\tt propSquare.check} with ScalaCheck (mentioned above), where {\tt
%%   propSquare} is the constraint $n^2>0$ for all integers $n$, we can
%% immediately get an input $n$ that falsifies the constraint:
%% 
%% \begin{lstlisting}[numbers=none]
%% scala> propSquare.check
%%        ! Falsified after 1 passed tests.
%%       > ARG_0: 0
%%       > ARG_0_ORIGINAL: 1083860448
%% \end{lstlisting}
%%  ScalaCheck first finds that n = 1083860448 produces an overflow
%%  wrapped to a negative (thus $n^2>0$ fails). The input is then
%%  ``shrunk'', in the terminology of property-based testing, to a smaller
%%  one, namely 0 in this case.







\section{Research Plan}


%%%ZF
%\subsection{WP1}
As prerequisites, all researchers involved in this project will need to learn
languages and tools involved in the project and related work.
They will learn about the Scala programming language and ScalaCheck
(a Scala implementation of the property-based testing) on the software side.
On the hardware side,
the researchers need to get familiar with Chisel, SystemVerilog, and
UVM.


\paragraph{Hardware Generators.}

The productivity of hardware design can be greatly increased by developing so-called
hardware generators. A hardware generator is a program that can generate a configurable
hardware description.
Scala with functional programming is an excellent basis for developing a methodology for the
development of such hardware generators.


%\subsection{WP2}
\paragraph{Property-based Testing.}
As a starting point, we will use ScalaCheck, an implementation of
property-based testing in Scala, for hardware testing. We will invite
hardware developers to write properties as constraints (like
propSquare above), and then we will use ScalaCheck to validate or
refute those constraints. Property-based testing has seen notable
successes previously, such as in locating a long-standing concurrency
bug in the Erlang database server~\cite{DBLP:conf/erlang/HughesB11};
it was also used by Ericsson to test its media
proxy~\cite{DBLP:conf/erlang/ArtsHJW06}, by Volvo to test car
communications protocols~\cite{DBLP:conf/icst/ArtsHNS15}.

The properties of interest for a hardware design can be expressed using a temporal logic \cite{Baier2008} (e.g., Linear Temporal Logic, LTL \cite{Pnueli1977LTL}) or similar formalisms. Those properties can be translated into
timed assertions for the testing.
Random test generation can adequately cover a hardware design by being guided by properties of interests, and by the design itself.



%\paragraph{Co-simulation.}
%
%\todo{A figure would be nice.}
%
%\begin{itemize}
%\item One use case for evaluation: cosimulation of a RISC-V simulator (Tommy) with an OS RISC-V HW 
%\item Ptolemy~\cite{ptolemyII-book} can be used to co-simulate the environment, supporting a model based design.
%\item Integration of C/C++ based models in the verification with Scala
%\item Java/Scala in UVM
%\item Hw/sw co-verification with Scala and so on, e.g., run an application on a SW processor model exploring some hardware artifacts (could be S4NOC)
%\item Model based design (Jan) with co-simulation
%\end{itemize}
%
%\paragraph{Assertions.}
%
%\begin{itemize}
%\item assertions during simulation
%\item Assertion ave been long part in SW, begin of C, but seldom used in HW and more complex assertions are interesting, such as when req is asserted, an ack has to become active within 5 clock cycles
%\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Constraint Random Testing and Fuzzing Techniques.}

Constraint random testing in hardware is similar to fuzzing in software testing.
We will add support for constrain random testing to ChiselTest~\cite{chisel:tester2}.
Once we have tools to instrument the hardware under test with a user-written
specification or automatically generated specification, we will be able to use fuzzing techniques
to validate those specifications. To this end, we will work
with our industrial collaborators to get access use cases serving
as the DUT.

\paragraph{Test Coverage.}

Code coverage is a useful tool for verifying digital designs
since it allows one to see which parts of their design have actually been tested correctly. 
We will implement coverage inside of the execution engine of the Chisel simulator using a technique
presented by Ira. D. Baxter~\cite{branch-cov-made-easy:2002}.
We will add a method to specify \textit{functional coverage points}, also known as
\textit{coverage groups} in SystemVerilog.


%Treadle, which is a simulation engine for Chisel, does not contain support for measuring code coverage.
%We will added branch coverage to Treadle so that one can see which lines of
%LoFIRRTL code, the intermediate representation used inside of Treadle, were covered by a series of tests
%and then know, using that information, which multiplexer paths were tested. 
%Furthermore, we plan to map the results obtained with LoFIRRTL code back to the source Chisel description.
%This mapping can be done using treadle's internal ``source trackers'' that associate some FIRRTL lines back
%to their chisel source. Once that is done, it will be interesting to move from branch coverage to functional
%coverage, which would require a way to define \textit{functional coverage points} also known as
%\textit{coverage groups} in SystemVerilog.

%\begin{itemize}
%\item On coverage and cover points in proposal (coverage of the RTL hardware, but also on the generator (Jack's comment, see \url{https://gitter.im/freechipsproject/chisel3?at=5f63c878603d0b37f43b67f3})
%\item Also have range coverage on individual signals and the matrix of 2 or more (see UVM example).
%\end{itemize}
%


\paragraph{Verification Framework.}

We will develop an object-oriented and functional framework for verification in Scala.
This framework is inspired by UVM, but will leverage Scala's conciseness with the
combination of object-oriented programming with functional programming.
An initial experiment of testing the accumulator circuit of the Leros processor~\cite{leros:arcs2019}
showed the that a test written with UVM was about 800 lines of code, where a Scala based
test was around 80 lines of code~\cite{verify:chisel:2020}.
Frist steps towards ChiselVerify are described in~\cite{ChiselVerify:2021}.
%However, UVM supports more functionality that a plain ChiselTest in Scala.





%\begin{itemize}
%\item Bus functional models
%\item Multiple languages
%\item Still talk about a small example taking it through all variations
%\item WP on VHDL generation from Chisel for better verification
%\item p69: HDL models are SW projects
%\end{itemize}


\paragraph*{Dissemination and Publication}

Scientific results will be published and presented at international
conferences (e.g., DATE, DAC, CAV, FPL, ISCAS, FPGA) and in relevant scientific journals
and two PhD theses.
%We expect that most tasks will result in at least one publication.
%One PhD theses will publish the results from the project.
We aim to publish in open access, to a large extent, in the gold open access model.
However, publishers such as ACM also allow publishing in green open access
at no additional cost, where a pre-print version of a paper can be uploaded,
for example, to ArXiv.

The results from the project will be available as open-source under the
industry-friendly BSD license.
%Open-source research projects attract
%other researchers, developers, and industrial partners
%to use and build on the results of the project.
A project web site will host the project documentation, the published papers, and the design's source code.
We will provide unrestricted and cost-free digital access to all research and development results.
%
We will use the developed method and tools to train a new generation of HW/SW engineers
at DTU and ITU.
In the middle of the project, we will have a coordination workshop with the project partners.
In the end, we will organize a design and verification workshop, including a hands-on tutorial,
open to all interested companies, and students from DTU and ITU.

\section{Practical Feasibility}

%The Embedded Systems Engineering section at DTU Compute provides
%the intellectual environment and the infrastructure (e.g., regression test server...) that we need for an ambitious research project.
%Furthermore, DTU Compute provides the infrastructure (e.g., an automatic test
%environment for regressions tests, web server).

%\paragraph*{Internationalization}
%
%\todo{Still waiting from SiFive for an ok for a stay.}



\paragraph*{Industrial Cooperation}

Danish industry in digital design for ASICs and FPGAs is currently in transition from using traditional
test benches written in VHDL and Verilog to a verification method based on constraint random
test generation with tools such as UVM. Therefore, the SDH project is just-in-time to support this
transition.
%
Following {\bf eight companies are interested in the SDH project} and support it with use cases.
Teledyne is interested in exploring Chisel for development and testing with the compatibility of VHDL and Verilog.
Microchip is interested in using Chisel to improve the design throughput and
provides a hardware use case to sort Ethernet packets according to their deadlines.
Synopsys provides tool support for the project.
WSAudiology provides a decimation filter use case for our verification framework.
Napatech will follow the project and offer challenges to the project.
Syosil will provide consulting and training in connection with any questions related to functional verification and UVM.
Comcores is interested in improving the throughput with SDH.
Huawei 


%\paragraph*{Use Cases}
%
%We will have several non-trivial use cases from industry and from our own development to verify
%our development.
%Microchip provides the specification of a hardware sorting algorithm.
%From WSA we will use a decimation filter written in VHDL.
%From our research we will use a multicore device, a network-on-chip~\cite{s4noc:nocarc2019},
%to explore concurrent, transaction based verification.

\paragraph*{Human Resources}

For the SDH project, we request funding of one PhD student.
Each of the senior researchers will contribute to the SDH research project.
%
%We intend to build a group with one PhD student, one postdoc, and
%two senior researchers at DTU.
%
%Quoted from the Diversity and Gender statement at DTU:
%``Diversity, equal treatment, and equality are integral to DTU, being an international
%university in scope and standard, and are fundamental principles underlying DTU's
%expectations of respect and equality''.
As the already named researchers are all male, we will actively search
for a female researcher for the PhD positions.
%However, the PhD position will be announced openly and men and women
%will have equal opportunities for applying.


{\bf Martin Schoeberl (MS)} is associate professor at DTU Compute and is the PI.
%His research interest is in computer architecture for real-time systems.
During his stay
at UCB in 2012 he picked up Chisel and brought it to DTU in research and teaching.
Martin has {\bf written the Chisel textbook}~\cite{chisel:book}, which has been translated
into Chinese, Japanese, and Vietnamese. Martin is a {\bf member of the Technical Advisory Committee for
Chisel} and therefore keeps the work of SDH in sync with the Chisel main development.
Martin is part of the regular Chisel developer meeting and a meeting on verification with
UC Berkeley researchers and developers from SiFive, a startup in silicon valley.


{\bf Jan Madsen (JM)} is professor and deputy director of DTU Compute.
His research spans methods
and tools for systems engineering of computing systems, embedded systems-on-a-chip,
Cyber-Physical Systems (Internet-of-Things), microfluidic biochips (Lab-on-Chip), and
synthetic biology (molecular computing). 

{\bf Alceste Scalas} is assistant professor at DTU Compute. His research interest is in
formal methods and programming languages to id software design, development, and verification. 

{\bf Martin Berger} works on processor verification at Huawei's Cambridge Research Center.
He is interested to apply the results of this project to processor verification.

{\bf PhD} we are looking for one PhD candidate with a background in computer engineering
with an interest in digital design and programming languages.

%\subsection*{Experimental Facilities}
%
%Development and simulation of the RTAI hardware can be
%performed on standard desktop PCs.
%For evaluation of individual design components small and cheap FPGA
%boards, that are already available, can be used. For the evaluation of the
%full system design of a switches with ANNs, we intend to buy three high-performance
%FPGA boards.
%%
%The needed software (e.g., VHDL simulation, FPGA compilation) is freely available.

\paragraph*{Tasks, Milestones, and Timetable}


%\paragraph{MS1.} The milestone is to have a empirical study on the effectiveness of our approach. In particular,  we will consider testing  two kinds of properties. The first kind is injected faults, of which we will measure our capability in detecting the faults. Another category is the expected code behavior, on which our approach should  pass without raising  warnings. 
%
%
%\paragraph{MS2.} We will create  a database from historical  bug patterns.
%A program transformer will be implemented to convert the bug patterns
%into code specification. The generated specification for our benchmark
%should be validated by our hardware developers, with which a
%refinement step can be introduced to improve the database.
%
%\paragraph{MS3.} The milestone  is to have a list of bugs reported, and a detailed case study (whether the bugs are
%trivial, false alarms, for example) Besides, coverage statistics will
%be collected to measure comprehensiveness of our tests.


The project is divided into several tasks.
%A researcher will be
%assigned to each task as its main developer.
%A cooperative
%working style will be encouraged so, that the experience and
%knowledge of the different team members will optimally be utilized.
For each task, the time is given in person-months (PM). The Gantt chart shows
the project schedule.
For an assessment of the project's success, we plan the following milestones:

\textbf{M1} (Month 6): The PhD student is selected and employed.

\textbf{M2} (Month 15): Tools have been learned, and first artifacts have been developed.

\textbf{M3} (Month 30): All development has been finished, and the different components
can be used for exploration and evaluation of the results with the industrial use cases.

\textbf{M4} (Month 48): The project has finished, and one PhD theses has been handed in.

\paragraph*{Success Criteria}

We aim to increase the productivity by a factor of two. However, measuring productivity directly
is not trivial as it varies between developers. Therefore, we will approximate it by comparing the
lines of code between two implementations and test done in UVM and with ChiselVerify.

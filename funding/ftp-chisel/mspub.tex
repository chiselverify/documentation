I have published four books, 28 journal articles, one book chapter, one patent, and 161
papers in peer reviewed conferences and workshops; 75 of the publications
as main author (38 of the 75 as single author).
According to Google Scholar,\footnote{Google profile at
\url{http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wiRNmwUAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao}
}
my papers are cited 4701 times and my h index is 37.
My ORCID is \url{https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2366-382X}.
% The first article (JSA 2008) was the \textbf{most cited article at JSA} of articles published in the last five years.\footnote{\url{http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaldescription.cws_home/505616/description}}

\subsection*{Five Most Important Publications}

\begin{itemize}

\item {\bf Martin Schoeberl}. A Java processor architecture for
embedded real-time systems. {\em Journal of Systems
Architecture}, 54/1--2:265--286, 2008.

This article summarizes my PhD work on a time-predictable Java processor
(called JOP). This article was the \textbf{most cited article at JSA} of articles
published in the last five years for several years (it is now out of the 5 year
window.) Its citation count is 248.

\item {\bf Martin Schoeberl}, Wolfgang Puffitsch, Rasmus~Ulslev
    Pedersen, and Benedikt Huber. Worst-case execution time
  analysis for a {Java} processor. {\em Software: Practice and
  Experience}, 40/6:507--542, 2010.
  
This article presents the worst-cases execution time (WCET) analysis tool for
the Java processor JOP.
The hardware design of JOP together with this tool is currently the only
solution for embedded Java where the worst-case execution time can
be predicted statically.

\item {\bf Martin Schoeberl}. Time-predictable computer architecture.
    {\em EURASIP Journal on Embedded Systems}, vol. 2009, Article
    ID 758480:17 pages, 2009.
    
This article take the basic ideas from the JOP design on time-predictable
computer architecture towards general purpose processors. This article was
the main article for my habilitation thesis, where I {\bf establish time-predictable
computer architecture as a research direction}.
Furthermore, the T-CREST project was based on the ideas presented in this article.
   
%\item {\bf Martin Schoeberl}. A time predictable instruction cache for
%    a {J}ava processor. In {\em On the Move to Meaningful
%    Internet Systems 2004: Workshop on {J}ava Technologies for
%  Real-Time and Embedded Systems (JTRES 2004)}, volume 3292 of
%  {\em LNCS}, pages 371--382, Agia Napa, Cyprus, October 2004.
%  Springer.
%
%This paper presents one of my first time-predictable features for a processor,
%the so called method cache, to simplify WCET analysis. This idea has been further
%explored by a whole PhD thesis by Stefan Metzlaff in Augsburg.

\item Christof Pitter and {\bf Martin Schoeberl}.
A real-time {Java} chip-multiprocessor.
{\em ACM Trans. Embed. Comput. Syst.}, 10(1):9:1--34, 2010.

Together with my first PhD student Christof Pitter we built a time-predictable
chip-multiprocessor based on time-predictable memory arbitration and
several Java processors. To the best of my knowledge this was the first multicore
processor that was WCET analyzable and supported by a WCET analysis
tool.

 T-CREST: Time-predictable Multi-Core Architecture for Embedded Systems.
 \emph{Journal of Systems Architecture} 61(9):449--471, 2015.
 
 
This article summarizes the research and development work within the EC funded
project T-CREST.

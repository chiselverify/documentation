	general-purpose processor cores that use the open RISC-V ISA, and
	provides both an in-order core generator (Rocket) and an out-of-order
	core generator (BOOM). For SoC designers interested in utilizing
	heterogeneous specialization for added efficiency gains, Rocket Chip
	supports the integration of custom accelerators in the form of instruction
	set extensions, coprocessors, or fully independent novel cores. Rocket
	Chip has been taped out (manufactured) eleven times, and yielded
	functional silicon prototypes capable of booting Linux.},

  abstract = {Hierarchical SDF models are not compositional: a composite SDF actor
	cannot be represented as an atomic SDF actor without loss of information
	that can lead to rate inconsistency or deadlock. Motivated by the
	need for incremental and modular code generation from hierarchical
	SDF models, we introduce in this paper DSSF profiles. DSSF (Deterministic
	SDF with Shared FIFOs) forms a compositional abstraction of composite
	actors that can be used for modular compilation. We provide algorithms
	for automatic synthesis of non-monolithic DSSF profiles of composite
	actors given DSSF profiles of their sub-actors. We show how different
	tradeoffs can be explored when synthesizing such profiles, in terms
	of modularity (keeping the size of the generated DSSF profile small)
	versus reusability (maintaining necessary information to preserve
	rate consistency and deadlock-absence) as well as algorithmic complexity.
	We show that our method guarantees maximal reusability and report
	on a prototype implementation.},

	techniques that improve averagecase performance. This paper introduces
	the Precision-Timed ARM (PTARM), a precision-timed (PRET) microarchitecture
	implementation that exhibits repeatable execution times without sacrificing
	performance. The PTARM employs a repeatable thread-interleaved pipeline
	with an exposed memory hierarchy, including a repeatable DRAM controller.
	Our benchmarks show an improved throughput compared to a single-threaded
	in-order five-stage pipeline, given sufficient parallelism in the
